## Grammarly - AI enhanced writing

- emphasised benefit of *hybrid* approach: LLM combined with other ML techniques and NLP
  - speed
  - reliability

### Brembo - Materials QA and Design

- materials QA automation
- materials design automation

- started in Automobiles, then Fashion, then other industries

- challenge: getting data is difficult (quantity and quality)
  - they use AI to 'multiply' to gen synthetic examples

- challenge: staff resistance to change

- challenge: manufacturing has low AI penetration compared to other disciplines like marketting
  - manufacturing seems more conservative
